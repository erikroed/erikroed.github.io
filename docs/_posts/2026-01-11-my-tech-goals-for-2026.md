![Tech goals for 2026][assets/img/tech-goals-2026.png]
Like many developers and tech enthusiasts, I have a long list of personal projects. Some are half-finished, some barely started, and some exist only as ideas. In 2026, I want to do a better job of finishing these - or at least getting them to a state this is *good enough*. 

This blog is one of the steps to achieve this. I want to use it as a form of motivation and accountability for myself — a place where I document what I’m working on, what I’m learning, and, most importantly, what I actually *finish*. The goal isn’t perfection, but progress.

So let's get to business and start by listing my tech goals for 2026, in no particular order:

- Post the first post on the tech blog ✅
- Replace the content in the [about](https://www.roed.dev/about/) page with information about me  
- Finish the first edition of my Ansible base setup for devices and VMs in my homelab
- Setup a new k8s cluster with Talos
- Restructure my home network, including better utilization of VLANs
- Do practical experimentation with AI
- Finalize the first edition of my neovim config
- Start using a window tiling manager

At the very least, this is a list of things I want to achieve during the year. It will also serve as the backbone for potential blog posts along the way. Hopefully, by the end of the year, I can revisit this list and check off most of the points.
