Some ideas for posts:
## Why techblog?
The main reasons for starting this blog are:

- To motivate myself to finish personal projects
- To deepen my technical knowledge through hands-on work
- To learn new technologies in a practical way
- To document decisions, mistakes, and lessons learned
- To build things *in public*, even if they’re imperfect

Writing forces clarity. If I can explain something well enough to write about it, I probably understand it well enough to use it.
